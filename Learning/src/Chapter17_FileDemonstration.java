 17.6.1 Interfaces and Classes for Byte-Based Input and Output:

InputStream and OutputStream are abstract classes that declare methods for performing
byte-based input and output, respectively.

Pipe Streams:
Pipes are synchronized communication channels between threads.  
Java provides PipedOutputStream (a subclass of OutputStream) and Piped-
InputStream (a subclass of InputStream) to establish pipes between two threads in a program.
One thread sends data to another by writing to a PipedOutputStream. The target
thread reads information from the pipe via a PipedInputStream.

Filter Streams:
		A FilterInputStream filters an InputStream, and a FilterOutputStream filters an OutputStream.
Filtering means simply that the filter stream provides additional functionality,
such as aggregating data bytes into meaningful primitive-type units. FilterInputStream
and FilterOutputStream are typically extended, so some of their filtering capabilities are
provided by their subclasses.

		A PrintStream (a subclass of FilterOutputStream) performs text output to the specified
stream. Actually, we’ve been using PrintStream output throughout the text to this
point—System.out and System.err are PrintStream objects.

Data Streams:
		Reading data as raw bytes is fast, but crude. Usually, programs read data as aggregates of
bytes that form ints, floats, doubles and so on. Java programs can use several classes to
input and output data in aggregate form.

		Interface DataInput describes methods for reading primitive types from an input
stream. Classes DataInputStream and RandomAccessFile each implement this interface
to read sets of bytes and view them as primitive-type values. Interface DataInput includes
methods such as readBoolean, readByte, readChar, readDouble, readFloat, readFully
(for byte arrays), readInt, readLong, readShort, readUnsignedByte, readUnsigned-
Short, readUTF (for reading Unicode characters encoded by Java—we discuss UTF
encoding in Appendix L) and skipBytes.

		Interface DataOutput describes a set of methods for writing primitive types to an
output stream. Classes DataOutputStream (a subclass of FilterOutputStream) and RandomAccessFile
each implement this interface to write primitive-type values as bytes.
Interface DataOutput includes overloaded versions of method write (for a byte or for a
byte array) andmethods writeBoolean, writeByte, writeBytes, writeChar, writeChars
(for Unicode Strings), writeDouble, writeFloat, writeInt, writeLong, writeShort
and writeUTF (to output text modified for Unicode).


Buffered Streams:
		Buffering is an I/O-performance-enhancement technique. With a BufferedOutput-
Stream (a subclass of class FilterOutputStream), each output statement does not necessarily
result in an actual physical transfer of data to the output device (which is a slow
operation compared to processor and main memory speeds). Rather, each output operation
is directed to a region in memory called a buffer that’s large enough to hold the data
of many output operations. Then, actual transfer to the output device is performed in one
large physical output operation each time the buffer fills. The output operations directed
to the output buffer in memory are often called logical output operations. With a BufferedOutputStream,
a partially filled buffer can be forced out to the device at any time by
invoking the stream object’s flush method.
		Using buffering can greatly increase the performance of an application
		With a BufferedInputStream (a subclass of class FilterInputStream), many “logical”
chunks of data from a file are read as one large physical input operation into a
memory buffer. As a program requests each new chunk of data, it’s taken from the buffer.
(This procedure is sometimes referred to as a logical input operation.) When the buffer is
empty, the next actual physical input operation from the input device is performed to read
in the next group of “logical” chunks of data. Thus, the number of actual physical input
operations is small compared with the number of read requests issued by the program.

Memory-Based byte Array Steams:
		Java stream I/O includes capabilities for inputting from byte arrays in memory and outputting
to byte arrays in memory. A ByteArrayInputStream (a subclass of InputStream)
reads from a byte array in memory. A ByteArrayOutputStream (a subclass of Output-
Stream) outputs to a byte array in memory. One use of byte-array I/O is data validation.
A program can input an entire line at a time from the input stream into a byte array. Then
a validation routine can scrutinize the contents of the byte array and correct the data if
necessary.

Sequencing Input from Multiple Streams:
		A SequenceInputStream (a subclass of InputStream) logically concatenates several Input-
Streams—the program sees the group as one continuous InputStream. When the program
reaches the end of one input stream, that stream closes, and the next stream in the sequence
opens.

17.6.2 Interfaces and Classes for Character-Based Input and Output
	Java provides the Reader and Writer abstract
classes, which are Unicode two-byte, character-based streams. Most of the byte-based
streams have corresponding character-based concrete Reader or Writer classes.

Character-Based Buffering Readers and Writers:
		Classes BufferedReader (a subclass of abstract class Reader) and BufferedWriter (a
subclass of abstract class Writer) enable buffering for character-based streams. Remember
that character-based streams use Unicode characters—such streams can process data
in any language that the Unicode character set represents.

Memory-Based char Array Readers and Writers:
		Classes CharArrayReader and CharArrayWriter read and write, respectively, a stream of
characters to a char array. A LineNumberReader (a subclass of BufferedReader) is a buffered
character stream that keeps track of the number of lines read—newlines, returns and carriage-
return–line-feed combinations increment the line count. Keeping track of line numbers
can be useful if the program needs to inform the reader of an error on a specific line.

Character-Based File, Pipe and String Readers and Writers:
		An InputStream can be converted to a Reader via class InputStreamReader. Similarly, an
OuputStream can be converted to a Writer via class OutputStreamWriter. Class File-
Reader (a subclass of InputStreamReader) and class FileWriter (a subclass of Output-
StreamWriter) read characters from and write characters to a file, respectively. Class
PipedReader and class PipedWriter implement piped-character streams for transfering
data between threads. Class StringReader and StringWriter read characters from and
write characters to Strings, respectively. A PrintWriter writes characters to a stream.

17.7 Opening Files with JFileChooser:
		Class JFileChooser displays a dialog (known as the JFileChooser dialog) that enables the
user to easily select files or directories.


Serialization and Versioning:
Declaration of Serializable Classes may change over time. The Variable serialVersionUID helps to ensure that the declaration 
of the class in both JVMs is the same.
			private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
 InvalidClassException the declaration indicates that the serialVersionUID are different in JVM that serializes and 
 deserializes the object.
